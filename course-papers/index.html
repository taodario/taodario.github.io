            <strong style="font-size: 20px;">The Dual Dynamic: Exploring the Correlation between Housing Prices and Crime Incidence</strong>
            <br><br>
            Using an economic model, the following paper explores the complex relationships between crime rates and housing prices in real 
            estate markets. The study shows a modest correlation where increased crime rates could potentially lower housing prices. The 
            research, however, suggests the economic significance of this correlation is quite minimal. The entire analysis was conducted 
            using STATA, and the findings underscore the need for further investigation into the interplay between safety, crime rates, 
            and their effects on real estate economics.

            <br><br>
            Central banks around the world took unprecedented policies to aid the economy in 2020 due to the COVID-19 shock. 
            This paper zones in on the United Kingdom during another financial crisis, where a new variant of COVID-19 was discovered 
            in mid-November 2021. Starting by introducing the economic scene before and after the crisis, a recommendation of financial 
            market liquidity operations will follow where the viability of long-term asset purchases, reduction of capital needed for 
            lending, and commercial papers are discussed.

            <br><br>
            As a relatively new retail payment instrument, Bitcoin is now considered the most popular decentralized
            cryptocurrency around the globe. A better understanding of this digital currency is necessary to help evaluate
            whether or not central banks should introduce their own electronic retail payment instrument. A variety of
            sources were used to gather the information within this report. This list includes news articles, web articles,
            textbooks, research studies, textbooks, the Bitcoin user agreement, and a literature review. Bitcoin logistics,
            including the pros and cons of using this cryptocurrency, are examined in this report.

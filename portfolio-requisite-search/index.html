        <h1>Course Requisite Relationships</h1>
        <p>
            Course Requisite Relationships is a unique platform aimed at enhancing the academic planning experience for students. With the primary focus on course planning, 
            it enables the visualization of course prerequisites and prerequisites in a simple and intuitive manner with directed graphs and course codes as nodes. It caters to the 
            unique needs of visual academic planning that current university planning tools fail to fulfill. The web application is built using Python, Flask, and jQuery on the server-side, with 
            NetworkX and Graphviz libraries for the generation and rendering of course graphs. The client-side uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create an interactive and 
            user-friendly interface. The website is deployed to and hosted with PythonAnywhere.

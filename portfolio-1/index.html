        <h1>Chess Engine Bitboards</h1>
        <p>
            This project, initially started as an end-of-year project for CSC207 at UofT, is focused on creating a chess engine using bitboards. 
            Given that there are 64 bits in a long datatype in Java, and perfectly 64 squares on a regular chessboard, 
            this was an efficient way to make calculations for valid piece move calculations and piece movement & capture using bitwise operations. 
            This project is built with Java and Java Swing for the GUI, and employs Clean Architecture principles and the Model-View-Controller framework.

            Here is a look at how the packages were organized to follow the MVC framework with a focus on Clean Architecture.
